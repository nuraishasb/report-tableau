In this project I analyzed comprehensive company data spanning sales from 2018 to 2021, encompassing information such as sale dates, geographical locations, products, discount usage, and shipping modes across diverse markets. Using Tableau, I gained insights and suggested strategies to enhance decision-making and boost productivity. I also conducted customer segmentation based on the findings, laying the groundwork for targeted approaches to improve customer satisfaction and engagement.
